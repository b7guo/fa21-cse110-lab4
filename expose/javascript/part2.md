1. 3 because the length of prices is 3 and the for loop iterator i add up to 3.
2. 150; Because variable discountedPrice has been reassigned 3 times in the for loop and the last assignment is 300*0.5 which is 150
3. 150; Because varibale finalPrice has been reassigned in the for loop and rhe last assignment is rounding the discountedPrice which is 150
4. 50, 100, 150; It will return the discounted list which is created and pushed to by the for loop 3 times to add the different final prices.
5. error; Because `let i` can only be accessed within the block it is defined in. `console.log(i)` is not in the for loop block.
6. error; Because `let discountedPrice` can only be accessed within the block it is defined in. `console.log(discountedPrice)` is not in the for loop block.
7. 150; Because `let finalPrice` is in the same discountPrices block with `finalPrice=Math.round(discountedPrice*100)/100` and `console.log(finalPrice)`. And finalPrice has been reassigned to 150 in the last iteration of for loop.
8. 50, 100, 150; It will return the discounted list which is created and pushed to by the for loop 3 times to add the different final prices.
9. error; Because `let i` can only be accessed within the block it is defined in. `console.log(i)` is not in the for loop block.
10. 3; Because variable length has been assigned to `prices.length` which is 3. and it is const variable so it would not change in the program
11. 50, 100, 150; It will return the discounted list which is created and pushed to by the for loop 3 times to add the different discounted prices.
